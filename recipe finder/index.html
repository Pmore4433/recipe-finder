It's a versatile dish that can be served as a standalone snack, in chaats (Indian street food salads), or as a patty in burgers. </p>

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>4-5 medium-sized potatoes (boiled and mashed)
                            <br>1-2 green chilies (finely chopped)
                            <br>1-inch piece of ginger (grated)
                            <br>1 small onion (finely chopped)
                            <br>Fresh coriander leaves (chopped)
                            <br>1 teaspoon cumin seeds,chaat masala,garam masala
                            <br>2-3 tablespoons cornflour or bread crumbs (for binding)
                            <br>Salt to taste
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1.In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, green chilies, grated ginger, chopped onions, and fresh coriander leaves.
                            <br>2. Add the cumin seeds, chaat masala, garam masala, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
                            <br>3. Add cornflour or bread crumbs to the mixture. This helps in binding the tikkis and prevents them from breaking while frying.
                            <br>4. Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape each portion into a round patty. If you want to make stuffed tikkis, flatten a portion of the potato mixture in your hand, place a small amount of filling in the center (such as peas or paneer), and then bring the edges together to enclose the filling and form a patty.
                            <br>5. Heat oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat.
                            <br>6. Place the tikkis in the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides. This usually takes about 3-4 minutes per side.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">Pancakes are a popular breakfast food made from a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and a leavening agent such as baking powder. They are cooked on a griddle or frying pan and served with a variety of toppings such as butter, syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.

                        <p><br>1 cup all-purpose flour
                            <br>2 tablespoons sugar
                            <br>1 tablespoon baking powder
                            <br>1/2 teaspoon salt
                            <br>1 cup milk
                            <br>1 large egg
                            <br>2 tablespoons melted butter (plus more for cooking)
                            <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
                            <br>2. In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using).
                            <br>3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if the batter is a little lumpy; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.
                            <br>5. Heat a non-stick griddle or frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.
                            <br>6. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake.
                            <br>7. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges start to look set, about 2-3 minutes.
                            <br>8.Flip the pancake and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes more.
                            <br>9.Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the griddle as needed.
                            <br>10. Serve. Share and enjoy!

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            <br>2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn‚Äôt get too brown or overcooked.
                            <br>3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            <br>4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling‚Äîbut don‚Äôt overstuff the omelette‚Äîwhen the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            <br>5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1.In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
                            <br>2.Add the crushed cardamom pods, saffron strands (if using), and bring the syrup to a boil.
                            <br>3.Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens.
                            <br>4.Add the lemon juice and rose water (if using), and stir well. Keep the syrup warm.
                            <br>5.In a mixing bowl, grate or crumble the khoya until it's fine and smooth.
                            <br>6.Add the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and cardamom powder to the khoya. Mix well.
                            <br>7.Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. The dough should be moist but not sticky.
                            <br>8.Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface.
                            <br>9.You can grease your hands with a little ghee or oil to help shape the balls.
                            <br>10.Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over low to medium heat. The oil should be moderately hot, not smoking.
                            <br>11.Gently slide the dough balls into the hot oil, a few at a time. Fry them on low heat, stirring gently, until they turn golden brown all over. This may take about 7-8 minutes.
                            <br>12.Remove the fried balls with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
                            <br>13.While the fried balls are still warm, transfer them to the warm sugar syrup.
                            <br>14.Let the Gulab Jamun soak in the syrup for at least 2-3 hours. They will absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.
                            <br>15.Serve the Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts or saffron strands if desired.

                            <br>1 tspn of pepper

                            <br>1 1/2 cups of Breadcrumbs

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.
